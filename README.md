# py-redisrollforward
py-redisrollforward is a continuous backup mechanism written in Python for storing Redis DB changes. It uses the Redis native Append-Only File (AOF) for this. It enables developers or sysadmins to roll forward a Redis database to a specific point in time (for troubleshooting and data recovery purposes).
